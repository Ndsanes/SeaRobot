## Project Description

This project is designed to help administrators unify the management of non-profit project groups, thereby improving the efficiency of information exchange. At the same time, so that more group chat administrators can benefit from this project, we are trying to make it as easy-to-use and scalable as possible.

## Project features

1. Free and open source.
2. The project is simple, easy to understand and develop.
3. Enables subordinates to complete the management process in one place, without the need to frequently switch software to view notifications, tasks or the latest news;
4. Seatable provides a web interface for managers who do not know how to code, making it easier to use, safer and more secure!

## How to install

The project is based on the NoneBot and Seatable projects, so you need to install both of them first.

### 1. Configuration of NoneBot

### 2. Seatable deployment (or parameter fetching)

Thanks to the Seatable team for providing the developer version of this project for free and for supporting the private deployment of their project. Without Seatable's support, this project would not exist!
